# Library Assistant

DOS application to manage books in a libary. This application was a project for senior high school.

This application was written in Turbo C++, a (now obsolete)compiler/ide provided by Borland. This compiler will be required if you want to compile the application from scratch. A binary is included, which can be run using [DosBox](http://www.dosbox.com/). You might need to fiddle with the emulation speed to run the application like it was meant in the old days :)
